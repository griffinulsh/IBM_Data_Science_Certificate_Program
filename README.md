# IBM Data Science Certificate Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the projects I've completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. This repository is organized by course, with each course folder containing Jupyter Notebook projects related to the course's content.

Please note that not every course produced Jupyter Notebooks for uploading. I've still included a description of each course below to outline topics I learned in the course.

## Courses 

Here's an overview of the courses included in this repository:

### Course 1: What is Data Science? 

-In this introductory course, we started with the fundamentals of Data Science. We covered how Data Science shapes decision-making today, using techniques like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks. We had the opportunity to hear from experienced data scientists who shared practical insights and experiences in the field.

### Course 2: Tools for Data Science 

-In the second course, we explored a range of tools, including Jupyter Notebooks, Git, GitHub, and more.

-Throughout the course, we learned how to work with these tools, understand their features, and use them effectively.

### Course 3: Data Science Methedology

-In this course, we focused on using skills to think and work like successful Data Scientists. We learned about various methodologies to tackle any data challenge with confidence.

-Two proven approaches were covered: Foundational Data Science Methodology and CRISP-DM's six-stage framework. These techniques, followed by experienced data scientists, provide a structured way to solve data problems effectively.

-We began by understanding how to define a business or research problem and learned hands-on techniques for data acquisition, preparation, and analysis. As we progressed, we crafted data models, deployed them, and even explored the art of data storytelling.

### Course 4: Python for Data Science, AI & Development

-This course introduced Pythonâ€”a crucial language for programming and data science. We learned Python basics, data types, and structures like Lists and Tuples. Practical tasks included using libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Beautiful Soup, along with tasks like data handling and web scraping.

-We worked in hands-on labs using Jupyter Notebooks to create basic programs, manage data, and automate tasks with Python.

### Course 5: Python Project Project for Data Science 

-This mini-course focuses on practical application of foundational Python skills in data work. We assume roles as Data Scientists or Data Analysts and engage in a real-world project using actual data and scenarios.

-Tasks include data extraction, web scraping, data visualization, and creating dashboards. We use libraries like Pandas and Beautiful Soup within Jupyter Notebook.

-By the end of this project we had notable additions to our job portfolio, demonstrating our Python capabilities.

### Course 6: Databases & SQL for Data Science with Python

-This course is all about mastering SQL. From basic SELECT statements to advanced JOIN concepts, we covered the gamut of SQL techniques.

-We learned to write SQL statements, filter data, understand DML and DDL, manipulate tables, and use functions. Practical labs and projects helped us build queries, work with Cloud databases, and employ data science tools. We rounded off our journey by analyzing real-world datasets, demonstrating our SQL proficiency.

### Course 7: Data Analysis with Python

-In this course, we covered essential data analysis techniques using Python, exploring topics like data collection, cleaning, modeling, and visualization. 

-Data Analysis Essentials: Extensively explored fundamental data analysis techniques using Python.

-Comprehensive Topics: Covered data collection, cleaning, modeling, and visualization.

-Practical Learning: Engaged in hands-on labs and projects, working with Python libraries like Pandas and scikit-learn to analyze real-world datasets.

### Course 8: Data Visualization with Python

- In this course, we implemented data visualization techniques to create compelling visual stories using Python.

- We created various types of charts and plots, such as line, area, histogram, bar, pie, box, scatter, and bubble charts.

- We also explored advanced visualizations, including waffle charts, word clouds, regression plots, and interactive maps with markers and choropleth maps.

- We used libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium to gain hands-on experience with data visualization in Python.
  
### Course 9: Machine Learning with Python

- In this course, we described various types of Machine Learning algorithms and when to use them.

- We compared and contrasted linear classification methods, including multiclass prediction, support vector machines, and logistic regression.

- We wrote Python code to implement various classification techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and regression trees.

- We evaluated the results from simple linear, non-linear, and multiple regression on a dataset using evaluation metrics.



## How to Use:

- Clone this repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.
- Navigate into the relevant course folder to access the Jupyter Notebook projects.
- Open the `.ipynb` files using Jupyter Notebook to view and explore the project notebooks.
- Please note that not every course has Jupyter notebooks as not every course had labs utilizing them.

Feel free to explore each project and gain insights into various data science techniques, methodologies, and tools that I've learned during my certification journey.
